## About

This is a project for the INDA-course at CDATE, KTH Sweden.

The program is a image processor meant to alter pictures. For example it can turn a `png`- or `jpeg`-file of any size into a *pixelart* version.

## Instructions

Execute the program with the prompt `java Program.java pixel Skog.jpeg` to make a pixelated version of the `Skog.jpeg`-picture.
